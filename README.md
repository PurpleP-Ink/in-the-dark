# In the Dark (Phaser 3 Game)
My first Phaser 3 game (yey! :D)

## ABOUT
Yes, this is my first game in Phaser 3. A basic platformer where you collect ores.
At first, this was going to be a story-based game. You got the ores for your greedy friend, and there was a 'y/n' dialog system where you could control whether you gave the ores to your friend or not...which I couldn't get to work bc i suck ;-;
